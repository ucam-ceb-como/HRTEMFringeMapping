## Description ##

The Matlab code was developed for the automatic mapping of fringes in high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of soot. It applies a series of image transformations to the original TEM image to map the fringes. Fringes length, tortuosity, curvature and inter-fringe spacing are measured by this code.
